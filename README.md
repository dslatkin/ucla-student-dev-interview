# UCLA Student Developer Interview Template

To use this template:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open [template.html](/template.html) in VS Code
3. Install Microsoft's [Live Preview extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server)
4. Click the "Open Preview" button in the top-right corner for that file

With live preview open, whenever you make a change to `template.html`,
`styles.css`, or `script.js`, the preview page will reload. You can click the
hamburger icon next to the preview page's URL to open dev tools, at which
point you may want to clear the dev tools console history to remove any
pre-existing messages.

> [!NOTE]
> You can ignore the files in `./devcontainer/` and `/assets/` for the
> purposes of the interview.
