# UCLA Student Developer Interview Template

To use this template:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open [template.html](/template.html) in VS Code
3. Install Microsoft's [Live Preview extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server)
4. Click the "Open Preview" button in the top-right corner for that file

With live preview open, whenever you make a change to the file, you'll see it
reflected immediately in the preview. You can click the hamburger icon next to
the preview window's URL to open dev tools, at which point you may want to clear
the dev tools console history to remove any pre-existing messages.
